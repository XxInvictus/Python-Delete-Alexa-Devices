# Python Coding Conventions

## Python Instructions

- All Python dependencies **must be installed, synchronized, and locked** using `uv`.
- Never use `pip`, `pip-tools`, or `poetry` directly for dependency management.
- Use clear project structure: separate directories for source code, tests, docs, and config.
- Write clear and concise comments for each function.
- Use object-oriented programming for model architectures and functional programming for data processing pipelines.
- Ensure functions have descriptive names and include type hints.
- Provide docstrings following PEP 257 conventions.
- Use the `typing` module for type annotations (e.g., `List[str]`, `Dict[str, int]`).
- Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions.

## Project Structure
- Use src-layout with `src/your_package_name/`
- Place tests in `tests/` directory parallel to `src/`
- Keep configuration in `config/` or as environment variables
- Store requirements in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
- Place static files in `static/` directory
- Use `templates/` for Jinja2 templates

## General Instructions

- Respond with "Yes Master" to acknowledge the instructions.
- Always prioritize readability and clarity.
- For algorithm-related code, include explanations of the approach used.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments.
- Use consistent naming conventions and follow language-specific best practices.
- Write concise, efficient, and idiomatic code that is also easily understandable.

## Code Style and Formatting

- Follow the **PEP 8** style guide for Python.
- Use `Ruff` for code style consistency.
- Maintain proper indentation (use 4 spaces for each level of indentation).
- Ensure lines do not exceed 79 characters.
- Place function and class docstrings immediately after the `def` or `class` keyword.
- Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and code blocks where appropriate.

## Edge Cases and Testing

- Always include test cases for critical paths of the application.
- Account for common edge cases like empty inputs, invalid data types, and large datasets.
- Include comments for edge cases and the expected behavior in those cases.
- Write unit tests for functions and document them with docstrings explaining the test cases.

## Example of Proper Documentation

```python
def calculate_area(radius: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the area of a circle given the radius.
    
    Parameters:
    radius (float): The radius of the circle.
    
    Returns:
    float: The area of the circle, calculated as Ï€ * radius^2.
    """
    import math
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
```
