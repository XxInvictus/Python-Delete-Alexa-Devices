# Alexa Manager Code Review Suggestions

## General Observations
- Code follows PEP 8 and PEP 257 conventions.
- Type hints and docstrings are present and clear.
- Sensitive data is handled securely and not logged.
- Project structure follows src-layout and separates config, source, and tests.

## api.py
- **Strengths:**
  - Uses type hints and descriptive docstrings.
  - API calls are rate-limited and use HTTPS.
  - Sensitive headers are imported from config and not logged.
  - Helper functions improve maintainability.
- **Suggestions:**
  - Improve robustness of `_safe_json_loads` (consider using a library like `json5` for flexible parsing).
  - Add more granular exception handling (e.g., catch specific JSON decode errors).
  - Log all skipped entities for easier debugging.
  - Consider async requests for performance if fetching many entities/groups.
  - Add unit tests for edge cases (malformed JSON, empty responses, missing keys).

## config.py
- **Strengths:**
  - Early logging setup to capture config loading errors.
  - Uses `tomllib` for TOML parsing and enforces Python 3.11+.
  - Docstrings and type hints are present.
- **Suggestions:**
  - Validate loaded config values and handle missing/invalid config gracefully.
  - Document expected config structure in comments or docstrings.
  - Consider using a configuration validation library for more robust config handling.

## main.py
- **Strengths:**
  - Follows PEP 8 and PEP 257 conventions.
  - Uses type hints and descriptive docstrings.
  - Organized imports and clear function grouping.
  - Logging is set up for debugging and error tracking.
  - Utilizes utility functions for progress bars, table printing, and formatting.
  - Configuration and constants are imported from a dedicated config module.
- **Suggestions:**
  - Break down large or complex functions into smaller, focused functions for better readability and maintainability.
  - Ensure all functions have complete docstrings, including parameter and return type documentation.
  - Add comments explaining non-obvious logic, especially around API interactions and data mapping.
  - Validate all external inputs (e.g., command-line arguments, config values) and handle edge cases gracefully.
  - Expand exception handling to cover possible failures in API calls, data parsing, and file operations.
  - Consider adding unit tests for critical functions, especially those handling API responses and deletions.
  - Document the expected behavior for edge cases (e.g., empty entity lists, failed deletions).
  - Ensure that dry-run mode (`DRY_RUN`) is respected in all destructive operations.
  - Avoid logging sensitive information unless necessary for debugging, and sanitize logs where possible.
  - Consider using async IO for network-bound operations if performance becomes a concern.

## models.py
- **Strengths:**
  - Uses object-oriented design for model classes.
  - Type hints and PEP 257 docstrings for classes and methods.
  - Organized imports and logging.
  - Utilizes external libraries (`tenacity` for retry logic, `rich` for console output).
  - Configuration values are imported from a dedicated config module.
- **Suggestions:**
  - Ensure all classes and methods have complete docstrings, including parameter and return type documentation.
  - Add comments explaining non-obvious logic, especially around retry strategies and API interactions.
  - Validate all external inputs and handle edge cases gracefully.
  - Expand exception handling to cover possible failures in API calls, data parsing, and file operations.
  - Consider breaking down large or complex methods into smaller, focused methods for better readability and maintainability.
  - Document the expected behavior for edge cases (e.g., empty entity lists, failed API calls).
  - Avoid logging sensitive information unless necessary for debugging, and sanitize logs where possible.
  - Add unit tests for critical methods, especially those handling API responses and entity filtering.
  - Consider using data classes (`dataclasses.dataclass`) for simple models to reduce boilerplate and improve clarity.

## utils.py
- **Strengths:**
  - Utility functions are well-organized and separated from business logic.
  - Uses type hints and PEP 257 docstrings.
  - Implements a rate-limiting decorator to control API call frequency.
  - Functions for progress bar and batch operations improve user experience and code reuse.
  - Imports and logging are handled appropriately.
- **Suggestions:**
  - Ensure all utility functions have complete docstrings, including parameter and return type documentation.
  - Add comments explaining the rationale for rate limits and any magic numbers (e.g., `RATE_LIMIT_SLEEP`).
  - Validate inputs to utility functions and handle edge cases (e.g., empty item lists).
  - Consider using external libraries for progress bars (e.g., `tqdm`) for more advanced features and better visuals.
  - Expand exception handling in batch operations to cover unexpected errors and provide clear feedback.
  - Add unit tests for utility functions, especially those handling batch operations and rate limiting.
  - Document expected behavior for edge cases (e.g., interruption during progress bar operation).
